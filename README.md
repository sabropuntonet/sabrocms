SABROCMS (CONTENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM) PHP SCRIPT TO EDIT WEBSITES

SabroCMS is a Freemium PHP Script that allows you to manage the files of your hosting or your website, from any web browser, either from your computer, tablet or cell phone, with online FTP functions, ideal for uploading files, deleting files, renaming files, clone files, create or delete directories and especially to create and edit files online, such as HTML files, Javascript JS files, CSS Style Sheets, Python PT Scripts, PHP Scripts, Perl, CGI and all kinds of TXT, XML, etc.

The only requirement to implement SabroCMS on your hosting or website is that you have access to your hosting, so that you can upload the sabrocms.php script to your hosting and that your hosting has the ability to run PHP files (which you can check with your hosting provider), Or if you would like to transfer your website to us or contract a professional hosting with these characteristics, you can also contract it with us here: [Sabro.net Hosting Plans], or you can even try our SabroCMS in Free hosting, with a Free subdomain included, which you could get by simply click here.

By having the SabroCMS Widget implemented on your own website, you will be able to update and modify your website, on your own, without any difficulty and without having to depend on any other person, because at any time you could edit and update the files and the contents of your website through SabroCMS.

SabroCMS is very easy to implement because you only have to generate a Free API Key on this website and later, You only have to upload a PHP file to your hosting that you can download here, after generating your Free API Key.

The SabroCMS Widget can be installed on any hosting that allows the execution of PHP scripts, just by uploading to your hosting a single PHP file, called sabrocms.php and running it on your own domain, from any browser, just by entering the address: www.[yourdomain].com/sabrocms.php
